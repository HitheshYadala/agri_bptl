            Agricultural College, Bapatla from the academic year 1983-84
            considering the demand for Agricultural Engineering graduates in
            this state and it was shifted to new campus on NH-216 in Karlapalem
            road in May 1994.The foundation stone for construction of the

            The college has the unique feature of being the only college
            offering B.Tech (Agril. Engg.) degree in Andhra Pradesh State till

            conducted by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and also through the
            UG- level ICAR exam. Further, there is an addition quota of ICAR
            (20%) and 15% quota through lateral entry for diploma students in
            agricultural engineering.

            After shifting to the new campus, the College expanded rapidly both
            academically and physically. Many infrastructural facilities were
            added in terms of buildings and equipment for improving the academic
            status in agricultural engineering. The College celebrated its
            Silver Jubilee in the year 2008 during which a silver jubilee
            building was constructed for a spacious digital library, book
            library and two classrooms. This college was accredited by Indian
            Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi during 1999-2000 in the
            first phase itself based on ICAR’s Review Team Report and during the
            subsequent phases also. The latest accreditation of ICAR for this
            College was in 2021-2026. The College was under the faculty of
            Agriculture until 2010 when a new Faculty of Agricultural
            Engineering and Technology was established by the University as per
            the provisions of the University Act. The College was renamed as Dr
            N.T.R. College of Agricultural Engineering (Dr NTRCAE) in the year
            2018 in memory of Late Dr N.T. Rama Rao the then Chief Minister of
            combined Andhra Pradesh and who was the person laid foundation stone
            for the College building.
